# Spatial gene expression analysis in Breast Cancer
Repository for the analysis of spatial gene expression in molecular subtypes of Breast Cancer

This is the repository for the code and data produced during the analysis of spatial organization of gene expression, performed in Breast Cancer transciptome profiles.

## Description of the code<a name="code"></a>
The analysis has been performed in R. All the code used to define, 
detect and anaylize DCEs can be found inside the [scripts](https://github.com/vntasis/SLE_spatial_gene_expression/blob/master/scripts/)
folder.
